Description: Provides robust and efficient calibration of any parametric power spectral density (PSD) models, especially for dynamical processes with extremely large number of observations. Three built-in estimation methods are provided: maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) based on Whittle-type likelihood, log-periodogram estimation and nonlinear least squares estimation (NLS). The package also provides a routine for removing most electronic noise in an automated pre-processing step, which would be very useful for spectral analysis based on recordings contaminated by various sources of instrumental noise in real-world applications.
